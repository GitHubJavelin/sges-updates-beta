    === For version 78 : Please make a full delete of previous versions before v78 and download again the full archive. ===
    Structural rearrangement of the files and folders.
    Enables incremental updates through the SkunkCrafts Updater. The updater is found on this forum.
    Caution ! The sole file skunkcrafts_updater.cfg should go into the root FlyWithLua folder ("X-Plane 12/Resources/plugins/FlyWithLua"), but all other SGES files go one folder below into "...FlyWithLua/Scripts/" as usual.

Version 77.1, 24th of november, 2025
	Enhanced support for the Boeing 747-200 was made in v77.0 with the Felis B742 freighter version, but the passenger version blocked FlyWithLua as an user reported. This is solved, now both B742P and B742F receive the same treatment.
